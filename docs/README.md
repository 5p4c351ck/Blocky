## Compile and run the program


SDL is a dependency, and it is not included, so you need to install it yourself,
example on Debian:

```

$ apt update && apt install libsdl2-dev libsdl2-ttf-dev
```


Compile with make

```

$ make && make clean
```
 

Run

```

$ ./blocky
```

**Note**: This project is currently under active development.
